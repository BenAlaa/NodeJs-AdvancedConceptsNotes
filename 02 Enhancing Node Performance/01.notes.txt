We can run nodejs server in cluster mode so we can create multible instances with multible eventloops so we can enhance node performance
We alsow can achive this by using "Worker Threads" and this is experimental teachnique.

Nodemoon note work correctlly with clustering

How to handle node clusters?
Cluster manager is resposible for handling all clusters


# Cluster Manager:
- cluster manager don't responsible for handling any request
- cluster manager monitor the health of all node clusters
- cluster manager can start instances, stop them, restart them and do adminstratoin tasks over them

# Clustering flow

--> Run node cluster.js 
--> execute cluster.js file 
--> create cluster manager 
--> startup worker instances 
--> cluster.fork() 
--> go to cluster.js and execute a second time

# Notes:
- when cluster manager start it has a property called "isMaster" = true
- when fork another instances these instances will not be master.
- we use this prop to check if this is master or note call fork()
- If we create many instances that don't mean that the app will be fast and to test that we will make benchmarking with "apache benchmark"
- ab -c 50 -n 500 localhost:3000/fast
