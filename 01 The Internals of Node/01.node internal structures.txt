1. Node concests of standard library moduls that written in JS and C++
2. This modules calls to parts, V8 & libuv
3. V8 => (javascript engin ) to execute javascript code
4. libuve => to access hardware resources and network and handle concurency
5. we use node above libuv because we need to write code in JS and let libuv do the rest of us to access resources

6. JS code --> Nodejs -> (V8 & libuv)

7. Node modules are cosider as API in javascript to access C++ code in libuv and V8
8. Some examples of these modules [http, fs, crypto, path]
9. every module written in JS and in C++
10. we can find JS side in "lib" folder and C++ side in "src" folder
